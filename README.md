Network topology project 

visualizing the internet architecture
created a network topology represents internet architecture through undirected graph where nodes are routers, and edges being the links between them.

pre-reqs;
used: python.
Input: routers data file CSV file
Used: Google colab, pyvis library for interactive network visualization

1. instantiate and create the network 
2. setting the physics of the network through Force_atlas_2based implementation to speed up the n-body simulation and grouping and holding the bodies together
3.establish the nodes and edges
4. create a interactive network, displying name of router,size, no of connected routers, list of connected routers for each router, size and colour of routers proportional to the node degree when hovered over the network

5. Node degree distribution and interpretation of Internet architecture created through histogram

6. Simulated Distributed Denial of service attack using mininet software and wireshark interface
